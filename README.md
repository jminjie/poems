# The Poems Game
A Balderdash-style game for poetry.

![Recorded demo](https://github.com/jminjie/poems/blob/master/new-demo.gif)

## Rules to the game
- First you can create a room or invite others to a created room by sharing the link.

- Choose an existing poem or input your own -- stanzas should be separated by a blank line.

- Then read the first n-1 stanzas of the poem (the last stanza is automatically hidden for you).

- Spend 10-15 minutes writing your own versions of the last stanza. It's useful to have a time cap here especially if you have some perfectionists in your group. Once everyone has submitted their version (remember to pay attention to formatting and indentation), one person hits the "All submission are in" button.

- All ending submissions will be displayed in a random order (everyone gets the same order). Read them and talk about them.

- Hit the "reveal" button to see the real ending.

## Self-host instructions
To run the client open the index.html file in your browser, or serve it over localhost with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or for python 3 `python -m http.server`.

To run the server on port 8080 run `go run server/main.go -port 8080`.

Make sure the hardcoded IP in the client matches the current IP of the server. On a single device you can use localhost:8080 but if you want to use multiple clients at once, you'll need to find your local IP and hardcode it, as each client has a different localhost. You can scan for active hosts on the wifi with `nmap -sn 192.168.86.0/24`.
